# Principal-Component-Analysis
Used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) implementation to investigate dimensionality reduction of the  “breast cancer” dataset provided by Scikit-Learn.

- Implemented PCA in two different ways:
a)	using the eigenvector decomposition of the covariance matrix
b)	using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method

- Provided a plot that shows the level of data variance retained as a function of dimensionality reduction.
